# three-react-tst

The aim of the project is to test the usage of the [THREE JS](https://threejs.org/) library inside a react project. The first goal was to make the canvas responsive. There are currently two ways of creating the canvas, one with vanilla THREE JS and the other with the [@react-three/fiber](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-three/fiber) and [@react-three/drei](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-three/drei) node packages.
